I come back out and he is waiting in the hallway, doesn‚Äôt say anything and I ask him if he has another mask as mine is ruined, he says no but that I can take it while holding a paper towel over my face for the rest of the time.

**Health Monitoring**

-	Daily check in (maybe live at https://dailycheck.cornell.edu/) for COVID symptoms.
-	Possibly require flu vaccine
-	Face masks policy live: https://ehs.cornell.edu/campus-health-safety/occupational-health/covid-19/face-covering-and-mask-requirements
-	Contact tracing recommended via phone app

**Testing**

-	Low threshold for testing including those in contact with Covid-positive cases
-	‚ÄúSurveillance Testing‚Äù regularly testing students and staff
-	Test students before they travel to Ithaca (remotely) and when they arrive
-	Testing students already in Ithaca and during move-in. Move-in may be 4 or 8 days to accommodate
-	Reactivation of key card and NetID requires completing a checklist

**Quarantine/Isolation/Contact Tracing**

-	Quarantine at permanent residence or Ithaca hotels, including possibly the Statler
-	‚ÄúStudents should be provided immunity from university disciplinary violations for activities they disclose during contact tracing‚Äù

**Modifications to Academic Activities**

-	Later start to the school year, no breaks
-	2 modes of instruction: all online, and in-person with remote access
-	Classroom capacity reduced to 13-24%
-	Wear masks in classroom, sit in assigned seats (bruh)
-	Virtual OH encouraged
-	Barton Hall or other large spaces repurposed as quiet study spaces to limit gatherings elsewhere
-	Regular grading reinstated
-	Attendance shouldn‚Äôt be counted for credit but should be taken to facilitate contact tracing
-	Recommend a stricter cap to 18 credit hours for mental health
-	Orientation should focus on behavioral expectations

**Modifications to student life**

-	Student Organizations encouraged to do virtual activities, among other considerations
-	Greek Life: ‚ÄúThe university should develop an addendum
to the Risk Management and Social Events
Policy that requires compliance with NYS
and local public health guidelines; wearing
masks when there are visitors in the house;
registration of public health monitors for
events; coordination with SCL to ensure
vendors are healthy and safe; and
registering the addresses of chapter
annexes.‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúSome advocated for strict enforcement with
strong sanctions, while others caution against
risks of pushing activities ‚Äúunderground‚Äù where
they may be more difficult to enforce.
Greek leaders expressed desire to be involved in
enforcement of behavioral expectations and
maintain close partnership with university
leadership. ‚Äú
-	‚ÄúThe university should suspend in-person
concerts and lectures that involve outside
guests and promote innovative approaches
to entirely new ways of socializing while
distancing.‚Äù

**Housing**

-	Eliminate quads and triples.
-	Rooms assigned to bathrooms to reduce # of people sharing
-	Lounges and kitchens remain open
-	Dining halls provide to-go service, tables properly spaced, cutlery disposable, reservations required for dine-in

**De-densification**

-	‚ÄúCampus can be de-densified by inviting only
some or none of students back for
residential instruction. If this option is
pursued, the following student groups
should be given priority: new students,
including transfer students; residential
advisors; graduating seniors (especially in
the spring); athletes (if competition will take
place for their sport); and students who would not otherwise be able to maintain
academic progress without access to
campus such as students in programs that
require hands-on access to special facilities
and those who lack access to internet or
quiet learning spaces at home‚Äù
    - Comments on this suggest it is not ideal. That is to say, they are proposing this as an option but NOT saying it is what should be done. In fact, the committee recommends AGAINST doing this. 

**‚ÄùCampaign for Public Health and Behavioral Influence Strategies‚Äù**

-	‚ÄúRecommend a system of progressive
sanctions. Initial response would involve
just the student and be educational.
Subsequent violations would involve
parent/legal guardian, if the student has
signed a FERPA waiver. Students could lose
access to university facilities and ultimately
be referred to the Office of the Judicial
Administrator for repeated violations that
necessitate formal discipline or removal
from enrollment‚Äù"

I was like ‚Äúdude this is barely 2 ounces of meat you gotta give me a little more‚Äù and he gave me slightly more and then I got back on the end of the line.

While on the line, I specifically watched him give every man 2 large scoops of meat and every women 1 small scoop for over 15 people (it was a moderate sized line and I was carefully paying attention because I wanted to be sure before I said anything). I got up to him again and he once again gave me a very small scoop and I said ‚ÄúDude, I just watched you give every man in front of me 2 scoops, I think you can give me 2 as well‚Äù and he gave me another without saying anything.

Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt have even been that mad if he had subconsciously given some people less but gave them more if they asked, but the fact I specifically asked and he said no is kinda fucked.

A Cornell Dystopia,792,ieo7ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/ieo7ct/a_cornell_dystopia/,27,1598122693.0,"  The year is 2037. ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù is synonymous with ‚ÄúCornell.‚Äù

During the 2020-2025 COVID-19 pandemic, Cornell was the only university to succeed in reopening, a Herculean effort that bankrupted every other university in the nation. With its multi-trillion dollar endowment it accumulated from the donations of billionaires from around the world, who lauded the success of the Big Red Vaccine, Cornell bought every other university in America. 

I‚Äôm a 2036 graduate living in New York City. Today is job enrollment day. Since my enrollment window isn‚Äôt until 4:00 PM, I decided to head down to the local Nasties to pick up some buffalo wings and signature Cornell ice cream. 

As I‚Äôm waiting in line, I overhear someone talking over the phone. It‚Äôs some software engineer from my class bragging about his brand new six figure salary. He got lucky with his enrollment window. I just hope there are more CS slots left, but with my time window, I‚Äôll be lucky to land any engineering job. 

Suddenly, I hear the familiar chime of the nationwide intercom system. It‚Äôs time for the national anthem. I immediately turn toward the nearest smiling portrait of President Martha Pollack, place my right hand over my heart, and belt out my loudest ‚ÄúFar above Cayuga‚Äôs waters...‚Äù The man on the phone appears to pay no attention. He‚Äôs immediately grabbed by secret CCCT agents standing in line and disappeared. 

As I stand in line trembling, I can‚Äôt help but selfishly hope that his job slot becomes available by my 4:00 enrollment window.

By the time I finish singing with a ‚ÄúHail, all hail, Cornell!‚Äù I‚Äôm next in line. I make my order. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll be 25.00 BRBs,‚Äù the AEP bot-cashier beeps. Since the collapse of the dollar back in ‚Äò21, Big Red Bucks have been the official currency of the United States of Cornell. I swipe my ID card, but it gets declined. Oh no! I forgot BRBs don‚Äôt roll over month-to-month. Embarrassed, I run back to my dorm room in Low Rise 21756. 

I check the time. It‚Äôs 3:55 PM. I hop on my computer and enter my Net-ID: ab345287 and my password into Citizen Center. Before I enroll, I have time to vote in the annual presidential election. I click on the election tab, fully expecting the usual two options: Martha Pollack and Martha Pollack. But, to my surprise, I‚Äôm instead offered the options of Martha Pollack and Walker White! He must‚Äôve hacked the election! I eagerly click on his name and submit my ballot. 

Suddenly, my internet goes out. *This must‚Äôve been a test, and I‚Äôve failed*, I think to myself while bracing against the back wall of my dorm room as I wait for the CCCT to bust down my door. But nothing happens. My internet comes back on. The ballot now has the two usual options. Dejected, I cast my vote for Martha Pollack and head to the enrollment page. 

It‚Äôs now 3:59. I‚Äôm watching the second hand of the clock app on my phone. Just as it strikes 12, I click ‚Äúenroll.‚Äù The page buffers. A minute passes. Then another. Finally, I‚Äôm greeted with my career options. The only slots left are in the fine arts. Without a CS slot available, not even 56 years of programming experience could grant me a software engineering job. Crying, I choose to be a painter. My projected annual salary is 10,000 BRBs. I have 400,000 BRBs in student debt. Can I even pay monthly interest? 

Before I can do the math, my door explodes and I‚Äôm placed in handcuffs. ‚ÄúCitizen,‚Äù an officer addresses me, ‚Äúwith your projected annual salary of 10,000 BRBs, you will be unable to pay the annual 100,000 BRB citizen tuition. As such, you have been found in violation of Amendment 35 of the Cornell Compact. Your diploma is hereby null and void and you are to be expelled from Cornell immediately.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sent to Canada, where I decide to enroll in the newly founded community college known as Harvard, renowned for being a refuge for Cornell rejects."

PLEASE consider what a shut down would mean for the people who work here,758,im6ysn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/im6ysn/please_consider_what_a_shut_down_would_mean_for/,69,1599184057.0,"Forget about classes moving online, forget about the in-person semester being over for everyone, forget about the vital research this university conducts being put on hold, forget about students being forced to return to shitty home environments, even forget about at-risk people dying.  These are things we talk about all the time and if it‚Äôs somehow not enough to keep you out of a fucking annex, then please consider the people who rely on Cornell for employment.

Because the fact of the matter is, a few more events by ‚Äúunnamed parties‚Äù gone wrong, and literally hundreds if not thousands of people here are unemployed OVERNIGHT.  Yes UNEMPLOYED.  Without jobs, without a stream of income, a.k.a. something necessary to feed, clothe, and house oneself when one‚Äôs parents do not do so.  The people who work in the dining halls to serve you the food you eat every day, the people who clean the classroom floors where you thoughtlessly dump your Canada goose jackets (yes I‚Äôve seen kids just throw them on the ground), the people who clean the dorm bathrooms for you, the people who do maintenance around campus.  All those people will be without jobs, at least until February, perhaps much longer if Cornell has to permanently lay people off to cover for the money they are hemorrhaging.

And it‚Äôs not just Cornell employees, its the countless small business owners, many of whom are immigrants without a backup plan, who have been staying open by the skin of their teeth betting on this semester‚Äôs success.  It‚Äôs the uber and Lyft drivers who ferry you around town, and it‚Äôs the families of all these people.

I‚Äôm not sure if any of you have ever taken the opportunity to *really* look around during your time here, but Ithaca, New York is not a hotbed of economic opportunity by any stretch of the imagination.  There aren‚Äôt a lot of entry-level jobs floating around for these people to turn to if things go south, especially not this year.  If these people lose their income, because of you, yes YOU, there are a lot of fucking consequences.  Some of them might lose their homes, their cars, their savings.  Some might not have savings.  If they have kids, those kids might now *eat* less because of YOU.  Those kids might not get Christmas presents this year because of YOU.  Those kids might now helplessly watch their parents suffer from depression because of YOU.  Newsflash, unemployment takes a toll on the mental health Cornell students love to bitch about a hell of a lot more than prelims (see this helpful link [https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coping-with-unemployment/art-20485976)).

I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôve noticed, but a lot of our dining hall employees are not young people, and if they lose these jobs, not only will their retirement saving stop, but they may need to dip into those savings to support themselves, delaying their retirement indefinitely because YOU couldn‚Äôt follow the rules.  These people are a part of our community just as much as any student is. I‚Äôll fucking die on that hill.  Most of them will be here or have been here longer than any of us, and they will be working here after we‚Äôre gone.  They are definitely more so a part of Cornell than certain unnamed fucking frosh who have already busted in here like they own the place.

You interact with them on a daily basis, you recognize them, they make everything run, they work incredibly hard, they smile and give you words of encouragement and fucking feed you.  If the campus shuts down, they do not go back to Westchester or Long Island or Miami or Manhattan.  You are indebted to them, you owe it to them to do everything you can to keep this semester alive.

What is a bummer of a semester for you, has potentially ENORMOUS implications for the lives of our staff here, and the college town community as a whole.  How dare you. How dare any of you forget about what is at stake for them this Fall.

TL;DR: If the semester ends, Cornell employees and business owners around here are going to get put in a very rough place, and it‚Äôs hard to watch people disregard that."

I met my girlfriend in an engineering class freshman year and we spent a lot of time together doing problem sets over the years in Duffield.  This meant many late nights together where we grew closer and developed a strong love for each other.  

I've made the decision I want to marry her and I think it's only fitting that I propose to her on the last day of classes (this Friday) in the Duffield atrium at around 12:30PM in the open area near the doors that lead outside to the engineering quad.  If some people are ready with cameras to record this, I will appreciate it since I know we'll remember this day forever.  

Full disclosure: Even though she's an engineer, I know she hasn't been on Reddit in forever so I'm not concerned about her seeing this in the next couple of days."

Appreciation Letter to Students from Dining Employee,694,fie8la,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/fie8la/appreciation_letter_to_students_from_dining/,4,1584167477.0,"Hello, 

sorry to interrupt your memes, trust me it's not something I enjoy doing, but in this chaotic moment I feel compelled to write this. 

I am a dining employee from Willard Straight Hall in my first year working for Cornell Dining. I wanted to take a moment away from all of the craziness that is happening this semester to show my appreciation for the students of Cornell.   


When I first accepted my position at Cornell, I was terrified at the thought of working around so many people. I have had social anxiety issues for over a decade now, and having a constant reminder of the bad in the world through media has never made things easier for me. Making the step to work for Cornell Dining was a huge hurdle for me mentally that I still struggle with from time to time, but I can tell you, that those days are becoming less and less the longer I work at Cornell. A large part of why these days are becoming less frequent is due to the outstanding character of the students of Cornell.

&#x200B;

There are so many of you that I get to make pizzas for on a daily basis. I see many of you multiple times a week, and even the few of you that I only get to interact with every once in a while constantly remind me how great the Cornell community is! I've worked in food service since I was 16 years old and in every other job I've worked, I've always felt like I'm ""just the guy making this persons food"", however; that changed significantly when I started working at Cornell. At Cornell, there hasn't been one time where I have felt disrespected, or just felt like the guy making your food. I constantly feel as though many of you genuinely care about us dining employees, and you truly appreciate the effort we make!  


I probably wouldn't have ever made this post until this last week. With all the chaos, and madness surrounding the Coronavirus and what it means for everyone on campus one thing became shockingly clear to me, there is no where else in the world I'd rather be working right now than Cornell. In a time where many of you are scared, and worried about what comes next for you, a lot of you still took a moment to ask a lot us dining employees what all of this meant for us and our jobs. 

&#x200B;

I have never felt more cared for by strangers in my life than I have felt this week. A student even took the time to write our bosses an email saying how much they appreciated the work we have done for them, and the seamless transition we made to make our dining halls as safe as we possibly can during this time. If you happen to read this, I want to make sure you know that your letter made so many people feel good about what we do, there were tears in the eyes of multiple people in the room as the email was read aloud to all of us. This moment is incredibly scary for us as we aren't sure exactly whats going to happen to dining over the next couple of weeks since it seems like everything could change an hour from now but knowing that there is an entire campus of students who genuinely care about our well being honestly means the world to us all.

&#x200B;

Lastly, due to all of this craziness, I hate the fact that I didn't get a chance to say goodbye to many of the seniors who have already left campus that I was able to make food for regularly and at many points get to have conversations with. If any of you happen to be reading this, I wish you all nothing but the absolute best and I'm so sorry you're not able to spend your last semester as I'm sure you envisioned it, but there is no doubt in my mind that many of you are going to change the world for the better since many of you have already done that for my life.

&#x200B;

Thanks for allowing me to share my thoughts and serve you all. I look forward to seeing you all when everyone can come back to campus, I know things are crazy right now but I have nothing but faith in you all to absolutely crush it for the remainder of this semester...now back to the memes."

Let‚Äôs save Cafe Pacific from running out of business!,670,jky1r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/jky1r9/lets_save_cafe_pacific_from_running_out_of/,58,1604069035.0,"\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

It's really touching to see all of your love and support for Fumi and Cafe Pacific. An alumna, Karen Perez ('19), has created a [Gofundme](https://gf.me/u/y6z8vi). Please consider donating if you aren't in the Ithaca area. Together we can save Cafe Pacific! 

Fumi (the owner) has approved of the fundraiser. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Cafe Pacific is Collegetown‚Äôs best kept secret. But sadly, the owner is considering shutting down the business. She told me she was barely able to survive this past summer, given how empty Ithaca was, and that this school year hasn‚Äôt brought as much business as she expected. She‚Äôs been there for over 10 years, and I‚Äôd hate to see her run out of business because of COVID.

For those of you who don‚Äôt know, Cafe Pacific is located across the street from Mango Mango and serves a variety of Japanese comfort dishes, desserts, and boba. The food is always delicious and the prices are fair. But above all, the owner is honestly one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met. She always makes an effort to talk to her customers and takes random acts of kindness to the next level. For example, when I ate there yesterday, she brought me and my friends an assortment of free cakes after discovering it was one of our birthdays!

Yes, the atmosphere is a little dingy, and the wait times can sometimes be a little excessive. But she essentially runs the whole restaurant on her own. She dedicates her life to serving this community. I say it's time to return the favor. So let's help her out during these trying times!

Here's some additional info about Cafe Pacific if you‚Äôre thinking about going:

* They deliver on [ithacatogo](https://www.ithacatogo.com/restaurants?collapsable=1)
* Also can order online through [paywithway](https://paywithway.com)
* They‚Äôre open 2PM-12AM, Sunday-Thursday and 2PM-1 AM, Friday-Saturday
* Consider paying with cash! Cash is always better for small businesses because credit card fees = :("

A grease trap left by the restaurant previously at that location has spilled fermented burned grease all over the back of the store, creating a significant slipping hazard and releasing ammonia fumes. The people working attempted to contact management to have the store closed and the problem fixed, but management ghosted them, forcing the in store supervisor to make the decision to protect the employees and customers by closing the store.

After this decision, a member of corporate came to the location and insisted we reopen, ignoring the health hazard and the concerns. In response, the workers walked out and began a strike. This is only possible due to the recent unionization of this location, along with the other two Starbucks in Ithaca. The health hazard caused by the grease trap is the last straw for many of the employees, who have been dealing with an abusive and apathetic manager, and many aggressive union busting attempts from corporate itself.

Employees and supporters are currently picketing on college Avenue, please show you support to them, they need the encouragement."

The lack of goth girls here are driving me crazy. Should I transfer?,580,18ep0jv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/18ep0jv/the_lack_of_goth_girls_here_are_driving_me_crazy/,87,1702161525.0,"

As a freshman boy here at Cornell , I am saddened at the lack of goth girls who attend here. The majority of girls here are Blonde Taylor Swift Starbucks girls or ratchet girls who seem to lack personality and originality. The underrepresentation of the goth girl subculture at Cornell is likely tied to a few aspects, how it is notorious for its partying, (not typically a goth girl interest) the constant vibrant and sunny atmosphere, (ditto), and the overall lack of diverse appeal. 

I know that my fellow freshmen male brethren are also disappointed at the lack of goth mommies here, they likely just conceal their pain better than I am capable of. Every single day I wake up and do my morning prayer hoping to spot an emo goth girl somewhere around campus, but alas, to no avail. Perhaps I am merely looking in the wrong places. If anyone knows where to find them please message me ASAP. Or if you are a goth girl reading this, don‚Äôt be afraid to shoot me a DM. 

I believe without finding a goth girl my mental health will continue to plummet and I‚Äôm afraid to know what I‚Äôm capable of if that happens. I may have to look into transferring if this issue does not get resolved. Any tips are much appreciated, thanks!"

You were trying to get help with a paper you wrote but the guy was being such a jerk about it.

The things he was saying to you were so nasty and mean that I could not believe it. Obviously you knew your paper needed work, that's why you were trying to get help. But nobody deserves to be put down like you were, no matter how rough your paper is. 

Who knows what you have going on in your life right now. Not every paper is going to be your best work and there's nothing wrong with that. I mean damn, even if you're the worst writer on the planet, that doesn't make you stupid and certainly doesn't mean you can't be successful and happy.

I was very upset overhearing these things. I would have stepped in to say something but I have autism and sometimes struggle with knowing what is appropriate to do in certain situations. When I got home, I talked it over with my wife and decided to make this post hoping you see it.

I would like to offer to help you with your paper. I am not the strongest writer,  but I'm certain that nothing could have hurt your progress more than the words of that jerk. I am glad your other friend was there to stick up for you as much as she could.

As an alumni, I am ashamed that that guy represents a part of Cornell, and said such mean things to you. You made it this far, you need to know that you deserve to be here and that you can do anything. 

Feel free to reach out for help with your paper, I'm sure there might be other folks on this sub that would be happy to help as well."

He was wearing a blue polo and white shorts and had sunglasses on. I thought not too much about it but after turning onto N Cayuga St, I spotted his car again as I was approaching the intersection at W Marshall St. I was heading towards Gimme Coffee so I crossed the sidewalk after he drove by. He turned into the Fall Creek Dentistry parking and saw that I was crossing the street to the other sidewalk and turned back around. I started freaking out but I thought I‚Äôd be safe if I went into Gimme Coffee because it was packed. He realized I was going to Gimme Coffee and drove into the parking lot next to Kinney Pharmacy. He got out and started walking across the street towards me.  He made visible eye contact with me and started making his way into the cafe and got in the line. I knew better and quickly walked away down Cascadilla Ave. At this point, I felt slightly relieved and picked up my pace so he wouldn‚Äôt know which way I went. I turned back after walking a safe distance and didn‚Äôt see anyone. But I did a double take just to be safe and saw him walking out of Gimme Coffee and looking around until I saw him look at me. He started walking towards me and I was terrified. I start panicking and running without looking back. I keep running and running until I finally turned around and saw that I lost him. 

I never have I been this afraid in my life. I know I should have tried to take a photo of him or the car to help others better identify him and avoid him, but I‚Äôve never been followed. In the moment I was so afraid I just wanted to make it back to campus and my place safely. I am extremely paranoid now and will never be going off campus alone.

Can we talk about how elitist and privileged so many people at Cornell are?,561,sqfmj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/sqfmj8/can_we_talk_about_how_elitist_and_privileged_so/,218,1644630137.0,"Since coming to Cornell from my decently small public school in the southeastern US, I have become increasingly aware, annoyed, and alarmed by the vast amount of elitism and privilege that goes unchecked here at Cornell. As a Government major, I also think that I've had a front seat to the many sociopolitical and socioeconomic misunderstandings that inhabit the thought processes of so many of my friends and fellow students. To be clear, I understand that this is a moot point to a lot of people and that many of the very people I am indirectly talking about are reading this. Still, I need to fucking vent about this.

Let‚Äôs just start with my first interaction at Cornell! I logged onto the first class of my college education on Zoom: an 8 am seminar-styled humanities class that I was beyond excited for. I had this awesome idea that it would be an introduction to the rigorous academic debate and exchange of ideas from different points of view that I would have to look forward to for the next four years. That was a funny thought. We started doing icebreakers, typical stuff like your hometown, pronouns, major, and name. Finally, it's my turn. I say I'm from \*insert Southern state/region and city here\*. Almost immediately, a fellow student unmutes themself and asks me, ""Do you guys wear shoes where you're from, or have you guys not got there, yet?"" leading to visible laughter in the boxes across my screen and only a semi-annoyed ""okay, sorry, let's keep going"" from the instructor. Wow. What a great way to start my college experience.

Now, understand this, I've got thick skin and I've heard a lot shitty things that are way worse, so it didn't really bother me. However, it made me keenly aware of what sort of response my background would receive and just how genuinely middle-class people are viewed by others at Cornell.¬†

I've been astounded by so many aspects of the past two years of my education. Some of the statements that have been uttered in my government classes regarding socioeconomic marginalization, of course by someone wearing a brand new, $7,000 Moncler jacket, would be better and more kindly said by saying, ‚Äústop being poor, idiots.‚Äù I‚Äôve also heard so many different punitive, elitist arguments regarding the southeastern US, my home, that I genuinely feel like I‚Äôm the star of a Comedy Central roast sometimes. Statements like, ‚ÄúJust listen to how they speak, you can tell that they‚Äôre stupid!‚Äù or, ‚ÄúWhy do we even care what happens down there? They voted for Trump, they deserve to suffer!‚Äù have become so persistent and constant to my damn ears that I‚Äôve just stopped trying to explain how fucked up they are.

Regarding politics specifically, the level of strictly performative activism that so many here at Cornell participate in and think is adequate is quite astounding. Quick newsflash: screenshotting an Instagram post and putting it on your Snapchat story is not helping anyone. I really cannot think of a better example of this than the Ganƒôdag«´ acknowledgment that we see at the end of ‚Äòwoke‚Äô students‚Äô emails, university correspondence, and so on. Is it nice to see that? Sure. Does it help heal the deep wounds that institutions like Cornell have wrought for decades? Hell no. See, some of y‚Äôall just don‚Äôt understand that acknowledgments and building-naming are only step one with issues like that. It might be history to those of you who shop at Chanel with Mommy and Daddy‚Äôs money, but it‚Äôs very real and very apparent for some of us.¬†

Speaking of institutional inadequacies in regards to socioeconomic status, let‚Äôs talk about Cornell and Financial Aid! If you don‚Äôt remember, last semester, a decent chunk of the student population that relies upon need-based financial aid to even think of going here didn‚Äôt receive their aid packages until October, or, in worse cases, November. If you‚Äôre part of the around fifty percent of the student population that does not rely upon assistance from the University, please try to understand the massive amount of stress that so many had to deal with, entirely unnecessarily. Having a hold on your account and dealing with hopefully empty threats of being put on probation/unenrolled for the Spring semester while also dealing with the shitty day-to-day worries of being a college student at one of the most difficult academic institutions in the world can be a little bit taxing.

Being one of these people, I arranged a meeting with one of the lovely Financial Aid counselors to discuss my Financial Aid package, as well as my options for living off-campus the following year. It would‚Äôve probably been more beneficial to ask this subreddit for advice. After getting nowhere with the status of my aid package, I asked how financial aid operates for students living off-campus and what I should expect my cost of attendance to be. I didn‚Äôt get an answer. Instead, the counselor asked me what apartment I was looking at. I showed them the property, the cheapest Collegetown apartment I could find at that time, only to be told that I should probably look for something ‚Äúmore within my means.‚Äù They continued this thought and told me that my financial profile indicated I was a ‚Äúhigh-need‚Äù student and that if I wanted an apartment like that, I would have to take out a considerable amount of loans because Cornell would not help. I would later find out that this was wholly false and that Cornell would indeed help, which was undoubtedly a great revelation, but the fact that I wasn‚Äôt told that by someone that worked in that very office was quite upsetting. My theory is that when fifty percent of the student population can afford to go here with no financial assistance, what seems helpful to someone in actual need can seem relatively adequate while truthfully not being sufficient in the slightest.

Finally, can we just mention how fucking ridiculous clubs are here? If you join ‚Äòextracurriculars‚Äô here, you should get a medal, as well as three additional credits to your graduation requirements because you are legitimately taking on so many useless, unnecessary responsibilities for little payoff. Past that, the process of getting into these clubs is equally as corrupt and tilted towards the advantage of elitists as the collegiate admissions process is, if not more.¬†

Listen, I am not making this post to get pity from strangers on the internet or anything like that. For one, so many people struggle with these dynamics, just as I am. Pity for me will do nothing for them. Secondly, I don‚Äôt want pity in the slightest; I want change. I would prefer structural, institutional change, but we all know that‚Äôs not going to happen. In lieu of that, I would settle for understanding from the privileged elitists that refuse to think about ‚Äòhow the other half lives. There are too many people here that so obviously do not realize how privileged they are to be here. There are too many people here who very clearly did not get in here on their own merits but, instead, they are here for the potential donations that the University could elicit from their guardian. Damn, there are too many people here that are only here because their parents went here or somewhere similar!¬†

Cornell was founded on the progressive, meritocratic principle of ‚Äúany person, any study.‚Äù A lot of us had to write a whole fucking essay on it to get admitted. It‚Äôs a great slogan, but it is simply not true for too many. I wonder way too often what my life would have been like if I didn‚Äôt go somewhere so targeted to privilege and elitism. The daily microaggressions and annoyances just pile up so high that I truly do not feel welcome nor meant to be here. As I walk the Arts Quad every day, I continuously feel like an outsider, surrounded by so many that have no definition as to what it even means to be an outsider. I have to remind myself, even now after years of being here, that I fucking worked my ass off to be here; that I deserve to be here. It‚Äôs pretty demoralizing that I have to do that so much, but it keeps me going. I know there are a lot of people out there that feel similarly, and I just want y‚Äôall to know that you‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre not lesser than others. You belong here just as much as anyone else that put in the work to call this place home. Keep your head down, keep working, and maybe one day we can make things a bit better.

To be clear, I am not trying to demonize anyone that has been blessed with a more fortunate upbringing. All I am saying is that the way things are now blatantly favors y‚Äôall while simultaneously making things harder for people that are struggling. This is a systemic/social argument, not a personal one.¬†

I'm still in shock and am afraid for my life everytime I leave my home.

The most unfair part about this is that she observed all the rules. She wore a mask, she tried her best to keep 6 ft from everyone and only went out to work at her job since she is an essential worker and my cousins family needs her income to live paycheck to paycheck. I just saw a post on this subreddit about someone who doesn't observe these simple rules and it PISSED me off. Idealistically, if most people observed the rules, we might have been able to flatten this curve earlier and maybe one of my favorite people on this planet wouldn't have died. I'm so angry with this world right now because it seems like people like me who are low income who HAVE to work to afford basic necessities are most at risk due to assholes like u/ascape2 who ignore precautions and asymptomatically spread the virus to us.

I also realize most people on reddit do follow the rules and wear masks and such, and so this post probably won't make much of a difference, but I hope it inspires at least one person to start following the rules. We as young healthy college students may not be the highest at-risk demographic, but we aren't immune to the virus and never know what could happen.

Some of y'all really need to revaluate how you treat professors,550,n2jka5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cornell/comments/n2jka5/some_of_yall_really_need_to_revaluate_how_you/,16,1619879761.0,"I know many professors have taken advantage of COVID to be shitty to students, but the same applies to students and professors. The amount of guilt-tripping and complaints over every little inconvenience is so embarrassing. Right now i'm specifically referring to the student who wrote an essay in the VIEN1104 EdStem about how unfair it was that they could not go back on their quiz and that they were ""denied the right to submit answers they were confident in"" despite their being a 60-minute time limit for an open-book 20 question multiple choice quiz (literally the answers were word for word from the lecture). The teachers in this class are sooo fucking nice and there's literally 10% extra credit (yes, you can get a 110% in VIEN1104 and the class is already straightforward). Students already complained about ATTENDING LECTURE so they doubled attendance points and reduced the # of lectures. I cringe the way some of you talk to TAs and Professors in office hours and interrupt class because you think a stressful semester excuses any individual accountability. You are not owed a free A this semester because of COVID. Shoutout to my one professor who responded to a student who interrupted saying ""i forgot about the quiz this week,  we need more announcements about module quizzes"" with ""I am not your mother"". There's complaints relating to student's general lack of organization and preparation that they're now putting on professors and blaming on the burden of COVID, in situations that there is no reason to do so. The way you complain would make it seem as if you are in the hospital awaiting a lung transplant for your COVID diagnosis. OBVIOUSLY there needs to be some level of understanding about accommodating increased stress, but this doesn't mean we just obliterate the standards that exist in any normal semester. Shut the fuck up, get a planner, and do your work, thank you!!

Heard the hazing process is kinda whack though. So crazy that some schools are trying to shut their chapters down. Something about self isolating for 10 days and having to do your finals as well? Also apparently they like to stick stuff up your noses once a week, kinda weird if you ask me. If any of the current brothers could give more info on the frat I‚Äôd appreciate it!"
